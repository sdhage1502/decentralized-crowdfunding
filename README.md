# 🧠 Decentralized Crowdfunding DApp

A **decentralized crowdfunding platform** built using **Next.js (App Router)** on the frontend and **Solidity smart contracts** deployed to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain. This DApp enables users to **create fundraising campaigns**, **view campaign details**, and **contribute ETH** securely using MetaMask. All campaign data and transactions are **stored on-chain**, ensuring full **transparency, security, and decentralization**.

## 🔁 Workflow

### 💡 1. Create Campaign
Users can start a new fundraising campaign by entering:
- Title
- Description
- ETH Goal
- Deadline
- Campaign Image

→ The campaign data is saved both on-chain and in Firestore (for real-time UI updates).

### 📢 2. View Campaign
Anyone can:
- View campaign details
- See ETH raised, goal, deadline, and contributors

### 💸 3. Contribute
Contributions are made via:
- **MetaMask (ETH)**: Recorded on-chain in the smart contract.
- **UPI (optional)**: Triggers a popup with UPI ID and QR code.

### ✅ 4. Admin Approval
- Campaigns require admin review before listing.
- Approved campaigns are displayed to the public dashboard.

### 🔒 5. Close Campaign (Optional)
Campaign creators can:
- Close the campaign to block further donations
- Update funding goals (if permitted)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**:  
   Using Hardhat, the `Campaign.sol` smart contract is compiled and deployed.

2. **Frontend ↔ Blockchain**:  
   The contract's ABI is used with Ethers.js to interact with MetaMask.

3. **Campaign Creation**:  
   On submission, the form data is pushed to:
   - Smart contract (on-chain)
   - Firebase Firestore (off-chain for instant UI update)

4. **Real-Time Sync**:  
   Campaign stats like ETH raised and contributors update live via Firestore.

5. **Security**:  
   - ETH transactions are recorded on Ethereum.
   - Admins approve campaigns before public visibility.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdhage1502/decentralized-crowdfunding.git
cd decentralized-crowdfunding
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Firebase

Set up a project in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), enable **Firestore**, and paste the config in `/firebase/config.js`.

```js
// firebase/config.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "...",
  projectId: "...",
  storageBucket: "...",
  messagingSenderId: "...",
  appId: "..."
};
```

### 4. Compile & Deploy Contract (Hardhat)

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
```

Then, copy the ABI to `/abi/Campaign.json`.

### 5. Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
